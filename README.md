# Neural-Networks-Deep-Learning
The project was accomplished by delivering 4 sub-projects. Part 1,2 &amp; 3 deploys a GUI powered by the neural network to build a regressor &amp; classifier respectively for a communications equipment manufacturer. The model predicts the equipment’s signal quality using various parameters from its products, which is responsible for emitting informative signals. Part 4 delivers an image classifier, which can classify numbers from the photographs captured at street level using a Neural Network
